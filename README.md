# Interface editor

This interface is useable for the 530+ revision of runescape cache, with some edits this will also be able to load osrs caches. I released this code to help the community, I wrote this code a long time ago and just recently started with refactoring it. It works but the code isn't the best (working on it :) )


# Usage
## Startup
Open the **config.properties** file. Chang the **cache_path** to your cache path, make sure to use \\ or / and end with it aswell. After that you can launch the jar file or use your IDE to launch **InterfaceGUI.java**
 > #Tool Properties
	cache_path=D:\\server\\data\\cache\\
	dump_path=dump/
	sprite_path=dump/
	version = 1
