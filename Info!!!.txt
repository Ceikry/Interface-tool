Make sure you always make a back-up from your cache.

if you want your component to render pure x & y based use position mode 0 for x & y  
---------My client crashed, what did I do wrong?---------
Things to check : 
					1. Did I gave a component a parent ID that doesn't exist? 
					2. Does the sprite exist? 
					3. Does the model id exist? 
					4. Is my color id right?
					5. Did I do something to the scripts?

If these things are correct remove the component and try again, or contact me!

---------misc info--------
List of current font ids
305 307 468 473 494 495 496 497 584 591 645 646 647 648 764 776 819 1591 2244 2710 3237 3793 3794 3795 4040 5419 5631 13120 13121

-------------scripts---------------
How does those scripts work in the script tab ? 

example :

1357;-2147483645;100;

full vieuw of the script

void script_1357(Widget widget0, int arg1) {
	widget0.setTrans(arg1);
	return;
}

what does the numbers mean? 

1357: is the id of script, the first number in the array is ALWAYS the script id
everything after 1357 are paremeters

-2147483645 : means it's the widget itself, if you want to trigger another component use it ihash.

100 : an extra parameter (so the trans will be 100% when hovered on the component)
